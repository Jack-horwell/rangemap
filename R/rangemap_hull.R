# rangemap_hull

# erase duplicate records
# create hulls depending in the user-defined argument (convex, concave, and alpha)
# split hulls based on a user-defined distance
# create a buffer based on a user-defined distance
# clip a world map based on the created buffer (resolution?)
# calculate areas
# return results
