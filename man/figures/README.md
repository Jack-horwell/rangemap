The two logos in this folder are the same but one is SVG and the other is PNG. I designed the logo to represent the output that is given from some of the functions, it is supposed to look like land and the ocean with the yellow dots being markers found on the map. The black font stands out against the blue background making it easy to read and the font is slightly stylized but not too much as to provide an interesting effect but maintain the readability. Looking at other hex logos showed that I should keep it simple and to the point, thats why there is not much happening on the image.
